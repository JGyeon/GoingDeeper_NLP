    "- 요즘은 모델을 처음부터 짜는게 아니라, 이미 잘 만들어진 모델을 가져와 내 입맛에 맞게 커스텀하고, 필요에 맞게 개량한다 라는 말은 자주 들었었다. hugging face 처럼 사람들이 공유한 것을 가져와 사용해 보거나, 간편하게 공유해서 올리는 등의 웹페이지를 알게되서 기쁘다. 확실하게 이해하고 넘어간 것이 아니라, 그저 노드와 다른분의 글을 참조해 따라가기 급급해서 정말 대략적인것만 알고 넘어갔기 때문에, 추후에 애프터서비스가 확실하게 필요 할 것이다. 꼭 이쪽으로 가지 않더라도 분명 필요한 순간이 올테니 꼭 기억해 뒀다가, 필요해 졌을때 유용하게 써먹을 수 있게 열심히 노력해야겠다:) \n",
